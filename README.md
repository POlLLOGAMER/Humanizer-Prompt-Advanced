# Humanizer-Prompt-Advanced
This is a specialized prompting for AI to humanize texts, with 100 percent effectiveness in many AIs, which means that no AI detector can detect whether a text is made with AI or not.

## More in depth detail
In this prompt, I use prompt engineering, in a very strategic way, and in a way that avoids ALL AI detectors, even the most popular one which is GPT ZERO, this makes a before and after in the era of AI, because it can make a text made by a human and by an AI indistinguishable.
## The prompt for the AI
Write an English text about common language mistakes, but intentionally apply ALL these errors as you write:

Mixing there/their/they’re : Use their instead of there (e.g., Their going to the park ), or they’re as a possessive (e.g., They’re house ).
Messing up your/you’re : Write your instead of you’re (e.g., Your right ) and vice versa.
Confusing to/too : Use too where to belongs (e.g., I want too sleep ) or the other way around.
Missing ‘s’ in plurals/possessives : Write cat in plural (e.g., two cat ) or childs toy instead of child’s .
Wrong verb tenses : Mix past and participle (e.g., I didn’t went ).
Misusing a/an : Write a apple or a hour .
Forgetting apostrophes in it’s/its : Use it’s as a possessive (e.g., The dog bit it’s tail ).
Repeating topics endlessly : Explain a mistake, then loop back to it without finishing (e.g., Make vs. do… make is for creating, like baking a cake, but do is for activities, though sometimes people use make instead of do ).
No capitalization/punctuation : Start sentences lowercase (e.g., ther problem ) or skip periods.
Random spaces : Split words like they re or it s .
Overusing very : Write very very very instead of stronger words.
Chaotic structure : Jump between unrelated topics (e.g., After explaining make/do , switch to a/an with no transition).
Extra rules :

No accents on Spanish words if they appear (e.g., tambien instead of también ).
Be slightly incoherent but keep minimal readability.
Make errors look human (e.g., typos like ther instead of there ).
Example of desired output :
Their house is over their. I want too no where they’re going. Your going to sea the diference. The dog chaced it s tail. I have two cat. She didn t went. I saw a elephant. It is very very cold. Make sure to do your homework… wait, no, make your homework?
