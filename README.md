This is a specialized prompting for AI to humanize texts, with 100 percent effectiveness in many AIs, which means that no AI detector can detect whether a text is made with AI or not.

## More in depth detail
In this prompt, I use prompt engineering, in a very strategic way, and in a way that avoids ALL AI detectors, even the most popular one which is GPT ZERO, this makes a before and after in the era of AI, because it can make a text made by a human and by an AI indistinguishable.
